Managed by Dr. Gestwicki of Ball State University.  This is the final project for the Fall 2015 CS 222 section 1 class.

## What is SKED?

SKED is a task management app created specifically for students.

### Another to-do list app?  Why?

There are a plethora of to-do list apps out on every app market, but they are mostly general purpose.  A simple to-do list app can only do so much when managing multiple classes which each have multiple assignments.  SKED is made to give students something that is specialized for assignments and make it easier to manage time.

### What can it do?

SKED is currently in the development stage.  v0.1 (beta) is scheduled to be released at the end of October, and will have the following functions:

 * View and modify a list of assignments and their due dates
 * Split assignments into pieces by creating subtasks
 * Get visual feedback of the remaining time for the assignment as well as progress made.
