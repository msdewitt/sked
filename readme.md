## What is SKED?

SKED is a task management app created specifically for students.

### Another to-do list app?  Why?

There are a plethora of to-do list apps out on every app market, but they are mostly general purpose.  A simple to-do list app can only do so much when managing multiple classes which each have multiple assignments.  SKED is made to give students something that is specialized for assignments and make it easier to manage time.

### What can it do?

SKED is still in an early development stage.  v0.1 allows you to:

 * View and modify a list of assignments and due dates

### How do I get it?

Make sure Java is up to date on your machine.  SKED is currently built on Java 1.8 using JavaFX.
